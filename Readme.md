# Music Generation Project
==========================

## Introduction
---------------

This project uses the music21 library to generate music. The goal is to create a system that can generate musical compositions based on a set of input parameters.

## Dataset
------------

The dataset used in this project is the Bach chorale dataset, which is included in the music21 library. The dataset consists of 382 chorales, each represented as a sequence of notes.

## Training Conditions
----------------------

The training conditions are as follows:

* SEQUENCE: The number of events in the sequence.
* SEQUENCE // 16: The number of measures in the sequence.

## Decoder
------------

The decoder can be either an LSTM or a GRU.

## Project Structure
--------------------

The project consists of the following files:

* `generate_dataset.py`: Generates the dataset from the music21 library.
* `model.py`: Defines the MusicVAE model.
* `encoder.py`: Defines the BidirectionalEncoder.
* `decoder.py`: Defines the BottomLevelDecoderRNN.
* `conductor.py`: Defines the ConductorRNN.

## Usage
---------

To use this project, simply run the `train.py` file. This will train the model on the dataset and generate new musical compositions.

## Notes
---------

* This project is still in development, and there are many ways to improve it.
* The generated music is not guaranteed to be good or coherent.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
